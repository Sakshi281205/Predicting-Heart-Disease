# Heart Disease Risk Prediction using Bayesian Networks

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a Bayesian Network trained on a simulated dataset of patient records.

## Dataset
- [Source (CSV)](https://bit.ly/3T1A7Rs)
- Includes fields like age, fasting blood sugar, cholesterol, thalach, and target (heart disease presence).

## Process
- Cleaned the dataset (duplicates removed, missing values dropped)
- Normalized numeric columns using Min-Max scaling
- Built a Bayesian Network with structure
